# What are Web Development Tools?
Web development tools support us in developing applications. They are available in various forms, like Browser extensions, plugins, or an IDE.
Which one can best support our daily development tasks? Let's have a closer look!
Finding the right tool can be tricky. There are multiple factors that we should consider when choosing a tool.
Complexity, security, scalability, cost, supported programming languages, and platform support are the factors recommended to check in advance.

## 1. Chrome Developer Tools
When we generally speak about dev tools, the first that comes into everybody’s mind are the Chrome Developer Tools.
And that’s all right. That is one of the most known and used web dev tools.
The tool has a set of web editing and debugging utilities built into the Google Chrome browser.
It helps view and update webpages and styles, debug Javascript code, and optimize websites from within the browser.
It has a tool called Lighthouse, which can perform audits on web pages and auto-generate reports based on performance, accessibility, progressive web apps (PWA), and SEO. 
Chrome DevTool can also perform local overrides and has web design features, like its inspect element tool or color picker.
It also has built-in security features, console utility, and device model.

Let's have a look at features worth mentioning.

#### View and change Page Content and Styles
Sometimes, we want to change the style or content of a page and immediately see the visual response, for example, to update paddings or to pick a good-looking background color.
Using the Chrome Dev Tools, you can directly accomplish this from the browser, without page refreshes or re-compilation, either by targeting HTML elements using the built-in console or by selecting the element in the HTML panel.
CSS prototyping is also possible. For this, you just need to select the element in the DOM tree and add declarations to it in the styles panel.
We can change font color, size, and type. We can change background and button colors, images, and so on.

#### Debugging Javascript
The dev tools provide a solution for debugging a web application.
Hence, all our javascript code is accessible and can be debugged directly in the browser.
That allows us to quickly locate problems, dig deeper into code, and debug and test out new code directly in the browser.
It has all the classical features you need from a debugger, like stepping over or into function calls or seeing values of specific variables.
And everything without log statements. We can also edit code on the fly without switching to an editor or IDE.

*One note, in applications where a bundler is used (webpack, vite, etc.), this feature only becomes useful once the source maps are sent to the browser as well.*

#### Running JS and viewing messages in the Console
It is also possible to run code directly in the built-in console or send messages to the console for testing purposes.
When we quickly want to try some code snippets, method calls, or testing selectors, the console comes in handy.

## 2. Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code is an open-source code editor that runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
The built-in features include syntax highlighting, auto-complete, and Git commands to make coding faster and easier.
The most common programming languages are all supported.
A huge variety of extensions are available in the application.
The user interface is customizable and offers the possibility to split the view and work on two projects at the same time.

Let's have a look at some features I use every day.

#### Command Palette
The most important key combination is Shift+Command+P (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows /Linux), which brings up the Command Palette.
From here, we have access to all functionality within VS Code, including keyboard shortcuts for the most common operations.
For example, we can run editor commands, open files, search for symbols, or see a quick view of a file, all in the same interactive window.
VS Code already has many commands out of the box, like save file, format file, git commands, and many others.
But the list of possibilities doesn't end here.
VS Code allows us to create new commands, and see them in this list of possible ones.
More extensions use this feature to expose their commands and enable their features.
The commands typically are grouped by topic, for instance, all the commands that work with the terminal have the prefix Terminal, those that work with git have the prefix Git, and so on.

#### Zen Mode
Zen Mode is a distraction-free view. All extra toolboxes and bars in the window are removed, allowing developers to focus completely on the code.
Center-align the code is possible as well, for an experience a view like a document editor.

#### Tag wrapping
Emmet is a set of plugins for text editors that allows for high-speed coding and editing in HTML, XML, XSLT, and other structured code formats via content assist.
Emmet can save time and improve developer productivity by helping to type less and generate more code.
For example, we can type "!" and press the enter key, and it will automatically generate the HTML snippet.
Another possible use case is, that if we are working on a Navbar with a few Nav links inside it, a snippet of a Navbar can be generated automatically by using a few keystrokes.
Whenever we write a valid tag, the Emmet abbreviation shows the preview of a code which is the final result in the editor.
By using shorthand CSS properties, it would be easy to generate styles by using Emmet.
Emmet comes in handy to write component snippets by just pressing a few keystrokes.
Emmet provides an ES7 module system, React, Redux, GraphQL, and React-Native snippets.

## 5. +1 Github
We also have Github on the list. It is a cloud-based Git repository hosting service.
It also offers a web-based graphic interface.
In my opinion, it is not a real web development tool, but it can support the productive development lifecycle very well.
Its key features are Github Copilot, pull requests and code reviews, codespaces, automation like CI / CD support, and many others.
